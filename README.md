# Project Title: PacMan Factory

## Description of Project: 
This is a project to create multiple pacmen images and make them move across the screen. Once they reach the bounds of the screen they should change direction. I added the chomping and flipping effects with the images provided. I also added a third button to delete the pacmen on at a time.


## How to Run:

Download the repo zip. Open the index.html in your browser to play the game.


## Roadmap of Future Improvements:

I would like the user to be able to click on a specific PacMan to delete it from the game.
